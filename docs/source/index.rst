   Cerda's command line interface.

Welcome to Cerda's documentation. This tool will allow you to transfer the files
that get rendered at renderfarm to either local disk or Dropbox account. Also 
there is a notification feature that allows you to get sent an email after a 
specific number of frames get rendered. Cool, innit?

.. note::
    This is intended to be used at NCCA labs only.

Follow these steps in the labs. I wrote how to install pip locally because we
don't have sudo privileges, pity. No worries it is literally **3 lines of code**
as I like to keep things simple.

.. warning::
    This tool is in early stage. Please contribute reporting issues on
    http://github.com/docwhite/cerda or directly by speaking to that Spanish shy
    guy in the labs, or drop me an email blanquer.ramon@gmail.com

Upcoming features:

* **Direct integration with Qube**: There will be no need to do all the steps to
  dispatch the job to the render farm.
* Improved mail formatting with **thumbnails** of what has been rendered.
