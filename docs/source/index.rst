Welcome to Cerda's documentation. This tool will allow you to transfer the files
that get rendered at renderfarm to either local disk or Dropbox account. Also 
there is a notification feature that allows you to get sent an email after a 
specific number of frames get rendered. Cool, innit?

.. note::
    This is intended to be used at NCCA labs only.

Follow these steps in the labs. I wrote how to install pip locally because we
don't have sudo privileges, pity. No worries it is literally **3 lines of code**
as I like to keep things simple.

.. warning::
    This tool is in early stage. Please contribute reporting issues on
    http://github.com/docwhite/cerda or directly by speaking to that Spanish shy
    guy in the labs, or drop me an email blanquer.ramon@gmail.com
